Hi folks, I am Eugenio and this is my academic website. I am an assitant professor at Politecnico di Milano, where I mostly teach, do reasearch and drink coffee. 

I have a PhD in Information Technology, I got it from Politecnico di Milano, where I also got my M.Sc. in Telecommunications Engineering. I've also spent some time at Northeastern University, Boston, and Nokia Bell Labs, Stuttgart. But my favourite city is Lecce, where I was born and raised. 

I like doing research about anything related to wireless networks. My active interests are network optimization, control and programmability applied to real-life cellular networks. Recently I have been working on expanding the Open RAN concept to innovative technologies and architectures. I love doing practical experiments with Software Defined Radios (SDRs), and I am trying to bring them in the course I teach. But I can't lie, there's nothing like a well designed mathematical model, especially when game theory is involved.
