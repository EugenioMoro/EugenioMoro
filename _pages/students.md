During my (short) carreer I have been working with a few students. I'm trying really hard to remember all of them to put them here. Most of them are M.Sc. students, but I have been helping with tutoring some PhD students in our group too.

Ongoing thesis students:
* Alberto Ceresoli, working on practical UE positioning in 5G networks through OpenAirInterface
* Tugay Ozel, working on measuring the impact of transport protocols on mm-wave access, in collaboration with Huawei
* Roberto Pegurri, working on integrating NVIDIA Sionna RT with ns3, in collaboration with NVIDIA France
* Nicole Perrotta, working on O-RAN based solutions for energy efficiency optimization, in collaboration with Northeastern University, Boston
* Manuel Colombo, working on 5G slicing traffic classification through O-RAN, in collaboration with Northeastern University, Boston
* Luis Ahmed Riaz, working on dynamic O-RAN fronthaul compression, in collaboration with Northeastern University, Boston
* Dennis Di Maria and Camilla Casiraghi (joint thesis), working on a techno-economic analysis of neutral host deployments, in collaboration with the Deparment of Management Engineering, Politecnico di Milano
