Starting 2025. I teach _Mobile Radio Networks_, part of the M.Sc. course in Telecommunication Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it). All the materials are avalable on [WeBeep](https://webeep.polimi.it).

In the past, I have have taken care of the laboratories and exercise lectures for the following courses:
* _Traffic Theory_, M.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it)
* _Mobile Radio Networks_, M.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it)
* _Tecnologie Digitali_, B.Sc. in Management Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it)

I had the pleasure to be invited to give a lecture on the use of Protobuf at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu), for the courses of _Wireless Sensor Networks and the Internet of Things_ and _Network Programming_.
